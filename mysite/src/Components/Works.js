        While attending University I kept busy with multiple activities.
        Most notably, I delved in game development publishing <a className='works-link' href="https://github.com/Cesarsk-Dev-Team" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">four mobile games</a> made with <b>Unity</b> on the PlayStore, and created a game engine from scratch with C++ and SDL.
        <br></br>
        All the while I enjoyed participating in competitive <a className='works-link' href="https://www.hackerrank.com/Shiro27" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online coding challenges</a> and deepened my knowledge with Data Structures and popular Algorithms.
